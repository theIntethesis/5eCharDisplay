      - Blood Channeler
       - Once per turn, you can choose to inflict a wound upon yourself to cast a spell without expending a spell slot. To cast a spell this way, you expend a hit die and roll a number of d6 equal to the level of spell slot you're replacing. You lose hit points equal to the total amount rolled. If you are reduced to 0 hit points this way, the spell you cast takes effect before you fall unconcious. You cannot cast a spell at 6th level or higher this way.
    You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

      - Quickened Recovery
       - Starting at second level, your wounds recover at expedited speed. At the end of a short rest, you regain an expended Hit Die. At the end of a long rest, you regain an additional amount of Hit Dice equal to your proficiency bonus.

      - Siphon Blood
       - Starting at sixth level, your control over your blood and the blood of others increases. You can use an action to create simple items as long as you have requisite blood to manifest them. For example, a small pool of blood might become a dagger, a small length of rope, or a stone.
