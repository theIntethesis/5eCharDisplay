 - Name: Arcane Ward
   Description: \t\t- When you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell’s magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has {ArcaneWardHP} maximum hit points. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.\n\t\t- While the ward has 0 hit points, it can’t absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.\n\t\t- Once you create the ward, you can’t create it again until you finish a long rest.\n\n
