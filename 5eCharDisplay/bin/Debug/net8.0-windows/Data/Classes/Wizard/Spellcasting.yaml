To do so, choose {numPreparedSpells} wizard spells from your spellbook. The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\t\t- You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.\n\n\t- Spellcasting Ability\n\t\t- Intelligence is your spellcasting for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.\n\n\t- Ritual Casting\n\t\t- You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.\n\n\t- Spellcasting Focus\n\t\t- You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.\n\n\t- Learning Spells of 1st Level or Higher\n\t\t- Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free.

When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher it and copy it. For each level of the spell, this process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp in material components needed to practice the spell, as well as the fine inks needed to record it.
